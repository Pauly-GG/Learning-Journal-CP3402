# Week 4 - Practical 3

## Learning Activities
This week, I worked on modifying the index template theme in WordPress to align with my start-up website’s aesthetic. I followed YouTube tutorials and WordPress documentation to assist me with creating child pages, as well as modifications to the template. In addition to the tutorials, I also watched some LinkedIn Learning courses to deepen my understanding of child themes, provided through the Learning Journal GitHub repository. I believe that knowing this knowledge may be valuable for our group project as it's essential to follow best practices when working with WordPress themes.

## Estimated Hours
I spent 6 hours this week on researching and creating my WordPress website. I spent 1 hour watching YouTube videos, however only the ones I listed in resources were helpful and assisted with my learning. I spent 1 hour on learning about child themes on the LinkedIn course. I spent about 30 minutes referring to WordPress documentation. The other 3.5 hours were used to create, modify and adjust my WordPress website.

## Content Insights
Child themes were a great way to customise existing WordPress themes without permanently altering the original design. By creating a child theme, it allowed me to make modifications that won't be overwritten during updates to the main theme. This was a terrific way to ease me into understanding the functionality of WordPress without needing to create an entire theme myself. In addition to customizing existing themes, I believe child themes are a great starting point for learning theme development in WordPress. They provide a foundation to build upon without having to create a theme from scratch. As a result, I discovered that child themes are a good first step in learning PHP, as they allow for the creation and modification of template files.
During this week’s practical we also got the chance to introduce and get to know everyone in the class with a round robin style one minute interview. I found this process helpful as I was able to ask questions specifically to what I’d be looking for in a potential group member. I asked a variety of questions that assisted with determining if other students in the class were compatible to work in a group with, such as availability and preferred working styles.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Child themes are a valuable tool for website designers, providing the ability to make changes to sites without altering the entire design of a template. I appreciate how using child themes makes styling more efficient and allows for changes to be made without fear of them being removed. Following the practical, I turned to LinkedIn Learning to further my understanding of child themes. The course provided me with some new insights that I didn't acquire from the practical, particularly in advanced CSS techniques that could prove useful in the creation of more detailed websites. Reflecting on my learning strategy from this week I found that following guides and tutorials while also doing the work myself is an effective approach for me. This process allows me to learn at my own pace and review concepts as needed, which has been helpful for several weeks now.
