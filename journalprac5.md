# Week 6 - Practical 5

## Learning Activities:
This week I utilised various resources, such as YouTube videos and the official WordPress documentation in order to learn about, and teach myself, how to create a child theme on WordPress. I also spent some time researching child themes in general, which taught me the importance of using one in website development and how to actually manage one.

## Content Insights:
WordPress child themes were a useful way to customize my website's theme, and functionality, without altering the parent theme's core files. It allowed me to add custom CSS and PHP code and make significant changes to my site whilst maintaining its integrity. Additionally, child themes offered a great introduction to PHP programming, and assisted with my overall understanding of the language. I learned that PHP’s syntax is very similarly structured to that of html, such as how the code is embedded in opening and closing tags, which assisted with my understanding of the overall language.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I looked into child themes after completing this week’s practical to see if I could learn some more about them as I found it quite interesting. One of the LinkedIn Learning courses provided from the week 5 calendar showed me advanced CSS techniques, such as media queries and Flexboxes to add responsive behaviours, that could be useful for designing detailed websites in the future.

Child themes are a valuable asset that allows developers to modify websites without affecting the template's overall design. The ability to customize styling while maintaining the core design can enhance the user experience and create a unique look and feel for the website. This knowledge will be useful for my future career as it’ll improve my ability to create custom templates for websites which will be both visually appealing, as well as functional.

Reflecting on my learning strategy from this week I found that, similar to previous weeks, I work most effectively when following a YouTube video at my own pace, pausing when required. I know this is most effective as this week I tried, again, to follow a written guide from the official WordPress documentation. However, I found this to more difficult to understand and follow, as more often than not, I’d get lost and not know where to navigate next, in addition to this it was also less engaging. Overall, I find that my learning is most effective when following a video guide.
