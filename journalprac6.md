# Week 7 - Practical 6

## Learning Activities:
During this week’s practical I was able to communicate with my team and discuss our ideas and strategies for our group assignment. Through team communication, we were able to come to a consensus about how we’d like to set up our group repository. I also spent some time researching, downloading, and setting up VSCode as it’s the IDE that the rest of my team is using. Some VSCode YouTube tutorials taught me how to use version control and navigate the new IDE.

## Content Insights:
Setting up an IDE for editing foundational code is essential for efficient software development. Collaborating on software projects requires a system for managing code changes, and GitHub is a popular platform that integrates seamlessly with many IDEs. GitHub allows team members to organize work, track code changes, and collaborate effectively, resulting in a stable and secure codebase. Using an IDE with GitHub can save time, reduce errors, and ensure high-quality end products.
Trello is a powerful tool for group teamwork and project management. It provides a simple, visual way to track tasks, prioritize work, and collaborate with team members.

Trello boards can be customized to fit any project, and team members can easily add, assign, and update tasks in real-time. With Trello, team members can stay organized and on track, ensuring that everyone is working towards the same goals. Trello's user-friendly interface makes it easy to use, even for those without extensive project management experience, making it an ideal choice for teams of all sizes and backgrounds.

At the beginning of our project, my team and I were enthusiastic and had a good understanding of the problem we were trying to solve. We all shared our ideas and were willing to collaborate to find a solution. We compromised when needed and made sure everyone's voice was heard. This created a positive and motivated work environment, making us feel valued as team members with our own unique strengths. We set clear expectations and worked efficiently to achieve our goals, making significant progress towards our objectives.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Employers are often seeking candidates who possess strong project management and collaboration skills, as these are essential for success in many roles and industries. By using GitHub and Trello in my projects, I have gained practical experience in these areas, which can make me a more attractive candidate to potential employers. Additionally, using these tools demonstrates my ability to work efficiently and effectively in a team, a highly desirable trait in many workplaces. Overall, these skills and experiences gained through the use of GitHub and Trello can significantly enhance my career prospects.

Upon reflection of my learning approach this week, I came to the realization that, like previous weeks, I work best when following a YouTube tutorial at my own pace. I find that this method is most effective because I can pause the video when necessary and take the time to fully understand each step. As an experiment, I attempted to follow a written guide from the official VSCode documentation for setting up Git in my IDE, but found it challenging to understand and follow. I often got lost and didn't know where to navigate next, and I found it less engaging than video tutorials. In summary, I have found that my learning is most effective when I follow a video guide.
