# Week 3 - Practical 2

## Learning Activities
This week, the focus was on the second practical of the subject, which involved using the Joomla CMS to create a website for my startup business. The task was to make a start on assignment 1, which required customizing and changing the default Joomla template to create a website that looked different and suitable for my startup. I spent some time researching different Joomla templates and settled on one that fit my startup's requirements.

## Resources and Links
I used the following resources to help me with my website design:

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/ for CSS formatting
- https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/launch-a-wordpress-website/?fbclid=IwAR2tFvtHH_oymzlZXjV86llnemhSV3_o-dugpP6mqsSMX6Nt1hjs839d1IQ for assistance with configuring joomla
- Various Youtube tutorials on css customisation for the Cassiopeia template, such as:

- Lecture material from the subject

## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 8 hours this week on researching Joomla and how to actually use it. Approximately 6 hours of which was spent figuring out how to change, add and modify various elements of the website. The other 2 hours was spent creating the website.

## Content Insights
During the second practical, I used Joomla CMS to create a custom website for my startup. To begin, I selected the only Joomla template that was available and customised it to fit my startup's branding and messaging. While customizing the template, I faced some challenges due to my limited experience with Joomla. However, I found that, after some research, I was able to change most of the design elements of the website. In reflecting on the practical, I realized that using Joomla was a great way to create a website, but it is definitely not the most efficient or user-friendly method for more complex projects, although this may be due to my limited knowledge with the software. In the future, I plan to explore other CMS options such as WordPress, to see how they compare to each other in terms of efficiency and difficulty.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After working on the second practical, I gained a new appreciation for using CMS platforms like Joomla to create custom websites. While custom coding from scratch can provide a more in-depth understanding of web development, using CMS platforms allowed me to focus on creating content and customizing templates to suit my startup's needs. This approach was particularly useful as I did not have a strong background in Joomla, and the platform's documentation and assistance from classmates were critical in helping me navigate the process. I found tutorials to be incredibly helpful as there is very little navigational and customisation information available on the website itself.

In reflecting on my learning strategy, I found that constantly referring back to Joomla tutorials whenever I needed specific guidance or assistance was particularly effective. This approach allowed me to reinforce my understanding of Joomla's features and functions, which I will undoubtedly find useful in future web development projects. Overall, the second practical was an excellent learning experience that allowed me to expand my knowledge of web development and CMS platforms like Joomla.
