# Final Learning Journal

## Learning Activities:

This week, I concentrated on the dual tasks of crafting my final learning journal and wrapping up the final assignment. I took measures to ensure that my journal was coherent and aligned with the examples provided on GitHub. I dedicated significant effort to fine-tune our WordPress website for the final assignment, ensuring it catered to the client's requirements and provided an optimum user experience. Given my primary involvement with the front-end CSS and SASS components, a significant portion of my time was devoted to debugging and optimizing these aspects. Assisting me in writing SASS and CSS was mostly by referring to code from previous practicals, and online resources such as W3Schools.

Throughout this course, I've developed proficiency in managing content management systems like WordPress and Joomla, honed my ability to write SASS and PHP, and gained experience in group collaboration. My web development skills and general writing ability have also improved, which is evident from the feedback I've received over the semester.

## Estimated Hours:
This week I spent approximately 7 hours working on the final assignment and learning journal.
-	5 Hours spent on Final assignment
-	2 Hours spent on Learning Journal

## Content Insights:
This week, the focus was on finalizing the learning journal and assignment, underlining the importance of coherence and alignment in content presentation. In the process of fine-tuning a WordPress website for the assignment, key insights were gained about front-end development. The usage of SASS and CSS in creating and managing visual aspects, especially when optimized and debugged, plays a pivotal role in enhancing user experience. Online resources such as W3Schools, along with references from previous practical tasks, are critical tools in understanding and implementing CSS to improve HTML's visual appeal. Simultaneously, gaining proficiency in managing content systems like WordPress and Joomla highlights the need for effective content management in delivering optimized user experiences.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights:
The learning experiences gained throughout this week have not only enriched my web development skills but have also paved the way for career growth. The practical application of SASS and CSS, for instance, has enabled a better understanding of the aesthetics and usability of a website, reflecting a skill set that is beneficial in a professional environment. This proficiency not only boosts employability in web development teams but also contributes to the creation of more visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

Furthermore, the exposure to content management systems such as WordPress and Joomla have fortified a skill crucial for creating user-friendly websites. This, in turn, positions me as a stronger contender in the website development field, as I’m now capable of managing content effectively.

Upon reflection of my learning approach from this week, I found that, this week in particular, my usual method wasn’t viable. This is because in previous weeks I’d follow a YouTube guide for a specific component of the practical. However, when completing the final assignment, I found that it was easier to navigate through W3Schools and implement code as I progressed. There wasn’t a particular YouTube video I could research for such a task like the final assignment, therefore this method wasn’t useful this week.
