# Week 5 - Practical 4

## Learning Activities:
This week I watched several YouTube tutorials that helped me learn about, and understand, how to run a localhost. These tutorials specifically taught me how to install and setup my localhost for WordPress integration. I also spent some time reading and researching the various parts of XAMPP, including what Apache is, and how it’s used for delivering web content. In addition to this I learnt how XAMPP utilises MySQL for database management.

## Content Insights:
Hosting a local environment was a great introduction to understanding how a dynamic website with an integrated database operates.
Creating a dynamic website allows for user interaction and engagement, enabling the website to adapt and respond to user input. With the use of a database, you can store and retrieve data, making it easier to manage and manipulate information on a website.
Having a local environment to work on allows for easy testing and debugging of your website before making it live. Using Localhost also eliminates the need for an internet connection, making it more accessible to work on at any time.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Learning about local hosts and setting up a local environment using XAMPP is a valuable skill for a web developer and for my future career. I know this is true because it allows you to develop and test websites locally, understand server configurations, and learn about database management, which are crucial skills in the web development industry.

Having a deeper understanding of how local environments operate makes you more employable for several reasons.
By having knowledge on local environments you can work with different tools and technologies, for example if you were required to work with a different local environment software that you were unfamiliar with, you would be more efficient in your understanding. Knowing how local environments work also assists with collaboration in the workplace. Being able to set up your own environment can allow you to more easily share code with others and collaborate.
In summary, having a deeper understanding of how local environments operate can make you a more versatile, efficient and collaborative employee, which can ultimately make you more employable.

Reflecting on my learning strategy from this week I’ve found that there’s a pattern with what’s most effective for me. For this practical I found that alternating between my work and YouTube tutorials, pausing when I need to, was most effective. I know this because in comparison to following a written guide, I’d more than often not be able to find what it was referencing and was just more tedious overall. As a result, I find that my learning is more effective when supported by relevant and well-designed visual aids.
