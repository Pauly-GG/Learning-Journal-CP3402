# Week 9 – Practical 8

## Learning Activities:
This week I utilized several different resources, such as YouTube videos and online articles/guides in order to test whether or not I could improve my approach to learning. All of these resources assisted me in creating a simple website using the PHP coding language and helped to understand it in more detail than my prior knowledge of the language.

## Estimated Hours:
This week I spent 5 hours 40 minutes testing my new learning theory and writing PHP code.
-	2 hours on Friday writing PHP using YouTube videos
-	1 hour and 30 minutes on Saturday writing PHP using YouTube videos
-	1 hour on Sunday writing PHP using the Pomodoro technique
-	1 hour and 10 minutes on Monday writing PHP using the Pomodoro technique

## Content Insights:
The Pomodoro technique involves breaking work into 25-minute intervals separated by short breaks, with longer breaks after completing a set number of intervals. By using this technique, you can improve your focus and productivity through retention of information.


## Career/Employment/Learning Insights:
The hypothesis for my test is If I use the Pomodoro technique to complete tasks, then I will be able to learn and complete tasks more effectively than if I go back and forth between work and YouTube videos.

For my I will use the Pomodoro technique to complete a task that I need to finish, which will be coding a simple website in PHP. I will work for 25 minutes without distractions, then take a 5-minute break to rest and relax. After four 25-minute intervals, I will take a longer break of 15-20 minutes before resuming work.

To measure the effectiveness of this experiment, I will track my progress over four days. Specifically, I will measure how much work I was able to complete, how much time I spent on YouTube videos, and how well I understood the material that I was working on.

After using the Pomodoro technique to create the PHP website, I found that it worked better than going back and forth between work and YouTube videos. I completed the website in 2 hours and 10 minutes using the Pomodoro technique, whereas I completed the same website in 3 hours and 30 minutes while going back and forth between work and YouTube videos. I also found that the website I created using the Pomodoro technique was of better quality in terms of design and functionality. Therefore, my theory that using the Pomodoro technique would help me learn and complete tasks more effectively than going back and forth between work and YouTube videos was proved true by this test.
