# Week 2 - Practical 1

## Learning Activities

This week I was tasked with working on my first practical for the subject. This involved creating a basic website for my startup business. To bring this website to fruition I used some basic and advanced HTML and CSS to create a simple website with three pages. I spent some time researching different design elements that would be suitable for my startup's website and used that information to create a visually appealing website that effectively communicated my startup's message.

## Resources and Links

I used the following resources to help me with my website design:

- https://www.w3schools.com/ for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript reference
- https://fonts.google.com/ for choosing and implementing appropriate fonts
- Youtube tutorials
- First year web design lecture material
- Inspect element feature on various websites

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 6 hours this week on creating and refining my website. Approximately 3 hours of which was spent researching and re-learning how to use HTML and CSS.

## Content Insights

I created a website called BusyBites that offers a subscription-based meal kit delivery service for busy professionals who want healthy and delicious home-cooked meals. The website has a simple and clean design that is easy to navigate, with a navigation bar that is consistent across all pages. I used a color scheme of green and purple, which gives the website a fresh and clean look. I also made sure to optimize images for web use, and structured the website with appropriate HTML tags for SEO purposes. The website has three pages: Home, About, and Meal Plans. Each page has a different layout, with the About page having a container with a border and padding, while the Meal Plans page has a section with multiple meal plan options.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After completing the practical, I realized that creating a website from scratch without relying on pre-made templates or platforms like WordPress was an excellent way to gain a more in-depth understanding of web development. Due to the fact that I had forgotten most of how to program in HTML and CSS, I had to independently further my knowledge. I turned to an online coding boot camp hosted by W3Schools that taught me some advanced coding techniques, as well as testing my skills along the way, which was extremely beneficial in the creation of my website. This approach to learning allowed me to fill in the gaps and expand my skills beyond what I had learned in the practical session and the previous web design subject from first year. By combining hands-on experience with guidance from advanced programmers and tutorials, I was able to obtain a deeper understanding of web development and efficiently create a startup website. The main strategy that worked best for my learning style was to navigate back throughout the bootcamp notes whenever I required a specific attribute to be created in my code. Thus constantly refreshing my memory and providing me with a reinforced understanding of some of the HTML and CSS concepts I learnt as I referred back to them several times throughout the practical task.
