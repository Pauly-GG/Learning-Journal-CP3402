# Week 10 - Practical 9
## Learning Activities:
This week, I utilized various resources such as online articles and guides to improve my understanding of Sass and its workflow. I watched YouTube videos to learn about variables, nesting, mixins, extend/inheritance, and how to automate my workflow using Grunt or Gulp.

## Resources/Links:
Articles/Guides:

Automating Workflow Documentation:
- https://gruntjs.com/getting-started - Grunt.js
- https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start - Gulp.js

## Estimated Hours:
This week I spent 7 hours working on the Sass practical.

- 2 hours watching YouTube videos.
- 1 hour and 30 minutes setting up a suitable workflow using Gulp.
- 2 hour and 30 minutes writing Sass code for the website.
- 1 hour debugging and making final adjustments to the website.

## Content Insights:
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to write more efficient and organized CSS code by adding features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance. Gulp and Grunt are task runners that automate repetitive tasks in the web development workflow, such as compiling Sass files into CSS or minifying JavaScript files. They simplify the development process, saving time and reducing errors.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights:

By learning Sass, developers can create more sophisticated stylesheets, which could improve the overall quality of a website. Sass could make me more employable as my CSS code will be more efficient compared to writing CSS code manually without using any preprocessor. This knowledge would make me a more valuable asset to any website development team, as I'd have a wider range of knowledge than just knowing how to write html and css.

Upon reflection of my learning approach this week, I utilised the Pomodoro technique from the week 9 practical combined with my previous usual learning approach of following a YouTube video at my own pace and pausing when necessary. By combining these two techniques I was able to work more efficiently compared to just reading through an online guide or article, as more often than not, I'd get lost and unable to navigate to what the text is referencing, which became a little frustrating. However, when using my new learning approach I never felt lost as I could follow along with the video, and by taking breaks it prevented me from feeling frustrated.
